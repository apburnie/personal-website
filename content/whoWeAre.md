We are a select group of practitioners at gunnercooke who specialise in advising on blockchain, Web3 and cryptoassets. One of the largest Web3 teams globally, we offer:

1. **Understanding of client’s commercial needs**: shown for example by the fact we accept payment in cryptoassets.

2. **Depth of expertise**: we have been advising blockchain companies since the first successful initial coin offering in the United Kingdom.

3. **Proven track record**: for example, we have been involved in over 10% of successful FCA cryptoasset registrations and assisted various regulators with shaping their legal and regulatory frameworks.

We hope that you find this website useful for finding out more about us, and how we can work together with you to raise the standards of the Web3 industry. Because together, **W**e’re **A**ll **G**unner **M**ake **I**t.
